        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American businessman who was the co-founder,
            chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney
            Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT.
            He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business
            partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

            Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was adopted shortly after
            his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled
            through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in
            1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with
            production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs
            saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user
            interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the
            breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the
            desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to
            feature vector graphics.

            In 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO, John
            Sculley.[3] That same year, Jobs took a few Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform
            development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he
            helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George
            Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The Graphics Group eventually spun off independently as Pixar, producing the
            first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and becoming a leading animation studio, producing
            over 27 films since.

            In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible
            for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive
            to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the "Think
            different" advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store,
            iPhone, App Store, and iPad. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. He died of
            respiratory arrest related to the tumor in 2011, at the age of 56, with Tim Cook succeeding him as CEO of
            Apple. In 2022, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
